#
#
#About 20 years ago, I wrote a program in BASIC that calculated the
#direction (compass bearing and angle of elevation) in which a satellite
#dish should be pointed in order to receive signals from any
#geostationary satellite, given the latitude and longitude of the
#receiving point on the earth and the longitude of the satellite on the
#geostationary orbit. The program worked just fine, and some people made
#use of it. However, there were few dishes back then.
#
#Much more recently, with the proliferation of dishes, I have seen
#people asking for this sort of program. So I dug out my old code and
#updated it somewhat, from the original Commodore BASIC to QBasic.
#
#But all BASICs are now somewhat dated, so to be really useful the
#program should probably be translated into other languages. This
#shouldn't be difficult. The algorithm is straightforward, involving no
#trickery. But... I'm not really familiar with any "modern" languages.
#So the translation(s) should probably be done by somebody else.
#
#If anyome feels like taking this on, please do so! The QBasic code is
#below. It's all public-domain stuff, written by myself. Distribute it
#however you want.
#
#Have fun!
